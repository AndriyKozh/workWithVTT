series so
currently we can read like everything

17
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
currently we can read like everything

18
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,790
currently we can read like everything
from the database

19
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
from the database

20
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,830
from the database
and we can also insert everything in our

21
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
and we can also insert everything in our

22
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,790
and we can also insert everything in our
database

23
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
database

24
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,310
database
and what we need to do left is maybe

25
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
and what we need to do left is maybe

26
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,950
and what we need to do left is maybe
i'm thinking like trying to to make a

27
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
i'm thinking like trying to to make a

28
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,429
i'm thinking like trying to to make a
way so that whenever you add a movie

29
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
way so that whenever you add a movie

30
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,950
way so that whenever you add a movie
to our database you don't need to

31
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
to our database you don't need to

32
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,630
to our database you don't need to
refresh the page because currently for

33
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
refresh the page because currently for

example

35
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
example

36
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,030
example
if i write here fast

37
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
if i write here fast

38
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,229
if i write here fast
and furious right and

39
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
and furious right and

40
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,069
and furious right and
i come here and write very good and i

i come here and write very good and i
submit

43
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200

44
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,110

nothing appears you need to refresh the

45
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
nothing appears you need to refresh the

46
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,630
nothing appears you need to refresh the
page so that it will

47
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
page so that it will

48
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,069
page so that it will
fetch the new information from the

49
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
fetch the new information from the

50
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,830
fetch the new information from the
database why is this happening

51
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
database why is this happening

52
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,310
database why is this happening
basically we are only wait let me come

53
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
basically we are only wait let me come

54
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,270
basically we are only wait let me come
to app.js

55
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
to app.js

56
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,630
to app.js
we're only getting the information

57
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
we're only getting the information

58
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,950
we're only getting the information
whenever the use effect hook is called

59
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
whenever the use effect hook is called

60
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,869
whenever the use effect hook is called
and this only happens once whenever the

61
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
and this only happens once whenever the

62
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,349
and this only happens once whenever the
page is rendered so we need to fix that

63
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
page is rendered so we need to fix that

64
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,108
page is rendered so we need to fix that
so that whenever we just click here we

65
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:05,119
so that whenever we just click here we

66
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,390
so that whenever we just click here we
don't need to refresh the page

67
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
don't need to refresh the page

68
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,910
don't need to refresh the page
and this is basically one of the best

69
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
and this is basically one of the best

70
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,830
and this is basically one of the best
things that react can do and we're going

71
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
things that react can do and we're going

72
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,350
things that react can do and we're going
to take advantage of that

73
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
to take advantage of that

74
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,350
to take advantage of that
and also i'm thinking we need to style

75
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
and also i'm thinking we need to style

76
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,510
and also i'm thinking we need to style
this a bit so that we can have like a

77
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
this a bit so that we can have like a

78
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,149
this a bit so that we can have like a
nice

79
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
nice

80
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,030
nice
card for each movie and in each card

81
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
card for each movie and in each card

82
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,310
card for each movie and in each card
there's going to be

83
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
there's going to be

84
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,510
there's going to be
maybe an update button and

85
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
maybe an update button and

86
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,310
maybe an update button and
a delete button so we can finish the

87
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
a delete button so we can finish the

88
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,109
a delete button so we can finish the
crud

89
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
crud

90
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,670
crud
aspect of our application which like up

91
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
aspect of our application which like up

92
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,149
aspect of our application which like up
it means

93
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
it means

94
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,710
it means
basically update and delete and i think

95
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
basically update and delete and i think

96
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,590
basically update and delete and i think
that's it

97
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
that's it

98
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,749
that's it
so the first thing we're going to do is

99
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
so the first thing we're going to do is

100
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,870
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to make the

101
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
we're going to make the

102
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,190
we're going to make the
application be able to update itself

103
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
application be able to update itself

104
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,990
application be able to update itself
cons

105
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
cons

106
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,190
cons
consistently so let's come here

107
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
consistently so let's come here

108
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,670

right so
let's make it so that whenever you click

500
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720

delete you can delete everything here

503
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,310
delete you can delete everything here
so let's come here and create a function

504
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
so let's come here and create a function

505
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,230
so let's come here and create a function
called delete review

506
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
called delete review

507
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,470
called delete review
const delete review

508
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
const delete review

509
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,670
const delete review
equal to like the arrow syntax

510
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
equal to like the arrow syntax

511
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,110
equal to like the arrow syntax
and let's make an x use dot

512
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120


513
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,389
delete request and instead of here we're

514
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,509
delete request and instead of here we're
going to set our url

515
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
going to set our url

516
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,110
going to set our url
i'm going to just copy this and

517
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
i'm going to just copy this and

518
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,389
i'm going to just copy this and
set it right here we're going to set it

519
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
set it right here we're going to set it

520
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,790
set it right here we're going to set it
equal to a slash api

521
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
equal to a slash api

522
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,230
equal to a slash api
slash delete because we're going to

523
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
slash delete because we're going to

524
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,069
slash delete because we're going to
create that and

525
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
create that and

526
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,069
create that and
let's send a variable maybe just the

527
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
let's send a variable maybe just the

528
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,269
let's send a variable maybe just the
the movie name movie name

529
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279


530
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,790
and now actually i'm thinking the idea

531
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,430
and now actually i'm thinking the idea
right

532
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
right

533
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,269
right
no but we're not setting the id okay so

534
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
no but we're not setting the id okay so

535
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,190
no but we're not setting the id okay so
let's just send the movie name

536
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
let's just send the movie name

537
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,550
let's just send the movie name
and that should be good

538
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
and that should be good

539
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,030
and that should be good
so let's go to our back end and let's

540
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
so let's go to our back end and let's

541
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,670
so let's go to our back end and let's
create a

542
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:28,680
create a

543
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,829
create a
app.delete api endpoint right so

544
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:32,839
app.delete api endpoint right so

545
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,750
app.delete api endpoint right so
app.delete

546
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
app.delete

547
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,910
app.delete
and this is going to be as we mentioned

548
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
and this is going to be as we mentioned

549
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,670
and this is going to be as we mentioned
before slash

550
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
before slash

551
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,269
before slash
api slash delete and there's going to be

552
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
api slash delete and there's going to be

553
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:43,670
api slash delete and there's going to be
a

554
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
a

555
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,949
a
require a response

556
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
require a response

557
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,310
require a response
and we're going to create a function out

558
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
and we're going to create a function out

559
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,590
and we're going to create a function out
of it so we're going to grab

560
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
of it so we're going to grab

561
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,430
of it so we're going to grab
first the the movie name so const name

562
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
first the the movie name so const name

563
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,710
first the the movie name so const name
equal to rec the body dot movie name

564
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
equal to rec the body dot movie name

565
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,750
equal to rec the body dot movie name
and let's create the

566
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
and let's create the

567
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,790
and let's create the
sql syntax for this right

568
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
sql syntax for this right

569
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,550
sql syntax for this right
so let's come here and

570
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
so let's come here and

571
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,829
so let's come here and
insert into movie we're gonna change

572
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
insert into movie we're gonna change

573
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,230
insert into movie we're gonna change
this

574
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
this

575
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,269
this
basically this is going to be delete

576
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
basically this is going to be delete

577
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,310
basically this is going to be delete
from the name of the database

578
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
from the name of the database

579
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,190
from the name of the database
the name of the table so movie reviews

580
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
the name of the table so movie reviews

581
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,389
the name of the table so movie reviews
and where

582
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
and where

583
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,069
and where
and this is the case right so where

584
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
and this is the case right so where

585
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,990
and this is the case right so where
movie name equal to whatever we're

586
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
movie name equal to whatever we're

587
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,030
movie name equal to whatever we're
setting right so

588
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
setting right so

589
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,389
setting right so
let's grab movie name and i'm going to

590
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
let's grab movie name and i'm going to

591
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,430
let's grab movie name and i'm going to
explain this better

592
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
explain this better

593
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,670
explain this better
movie name equal to question mark so

594
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
movie name equal to question mark so

595
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,590
movie name equal to question mark so
basically what we're saying here is

596
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
basically what we're saying here is

597
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,310
basically what we're saying here is
delete from the table where the movie

598
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
delete from the table where the movie

599
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,110
delete from the table where the movie
name

600
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
name

601
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,509
name
is equal to the movie name that we set

602
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
is equal to the movie name that we set

603
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,310
is equal to the movie name that we set
over here so

604
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
over here so

605
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,550
over here so
we're deleting whatever movie has this

606
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
we're deleting whatever movie has this

607
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,949
we're deleting whatever movie has this
name and

608
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
name and

609
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,269
name and
if we come here the reason why we're

610
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
if we come here the reason why we're

611
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,150
if we come here the reason why we're
putting a question

612
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
putting a question

613
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,150
putting a question
mark as i said in the last video is so

614
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
mark as i said in the last video is so

615
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,670
mark as i said in the last video is so
that we can sanitize our input so

616
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
that we can sanitize our input so

617
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,310
that we can sanitize our input so
basically

618
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
basically

619
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,069
basically
we can just set the variable here

620
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
we can just set the variable here

621
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,350
we can just set the variable here
instead of directly

622
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
instead of directly

623
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,230
instead of directly
inside of the the string and this is

624
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
inside of the the string and this is

625
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,750
inside of the the string and this is
important for

626
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
important for

627
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,470
important for
for various different reasons so if i

628
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
for various different reasons so if i

629
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,870
for various different reasons so if i
come here and put

630
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:11,880
come here and put

631
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,710
come here and put
database.query and i add

632
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
database.query and i add

633
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,790
database.query and i add
the sql oh i'm going to change this name

634
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
the sql oh i'm going to change this name

635
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,829
the sql oh i'm going to change this name
so ask

636
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
so ask

637
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,550
so ask
ql delete and i add this variable here

638
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
ql delete and i add this variable here

639
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,110
ql delete and i add this variable here
and then on the side i add the name and

640
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
and then on the side i add the name and

641
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,389
and then on the side i add the name and
as you can see like

642
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
as you can see like

643
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,550
as you can see like
since this is only taking one variable i

644
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
since this is only taking one variable i

645
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,670
since this is only taking one variable i
don't need to create a

646
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
don't need to create a

647
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,190
don't need to create a
an array like i created last time

648
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
an array like i created last time

649
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,110
an array like i created last time
because this time i was setting two

650
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
because this time i was setting two

651
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,550
because this time i was setting two
variables two question marks and this

652
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
variables two question marks and this

653
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,990
variables two question marks and this
one i'm only setting once

654
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
one i'm only setting once

655
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,629
one i'm only setting once
and that also comes into place when i'm

656
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
and that also comes into place when i'm

657
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,910
and that also comes into place when i'm
when i'm sending

658
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
when i'm sending

659
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,310
when i'm sending
the data through the access request as

660
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
the data through the access request as

661
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,350
the data through the access request as
you can see on the

662
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
you can see on the

663
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,590
you can see on the
actual stop post where we inserted data

664
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
actual stop post where we inserted data

665
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,550
actual stop post where we inserted data
into the database

666
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
into the database

667
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,310
into the database
we're sending two pieces of information

668
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
we're sending two pieces of information

669
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,750
we're sending two pieces of information
the movie name and the movie review

670
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
the movie name and the movie review

671
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,590
the movie name and the movie review
that's why we created an object but in

672
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
that's why we created an object but in

673
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,350
that's why we created an object but in
this case we're only setting

674
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
this case we're only setting

675
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,790
this case we're only setting
uh one object one one variable which is

676
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
uh one object one one variable which is

677
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,990
uh one object one one variable which is
the movie name so we don't really need

678
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
the movie name so we don't really need

679
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,509
the movie name so we don't really need
to create an object out of it

680
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
to create an object out of it

681
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,030
to create an object out of it
so now we have this function right here

682
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
so now we have this function right here

683
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,870
so now we have this function right here
right so we have the delete review

684
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
right so we have the delete review

685
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,069
right so we have the delete review
and we created the app.delete

686
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
and we created the app.delete

687
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,509
and we created the app.delete
route on the back end we just need to

688
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
route on the back end we just need to

689
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,230
route on the back end we just need to
then set a a function out of this so

690
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
then set a a function out of this so

691
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,509
then set a a function out of this so
error results and

692
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519


693
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,829
let's grab this information and i'm also

694
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,269
let's grab this information and i'm also
going to do this

695
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
going to do this

696
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,269
going to do this
so inside of here if we have any error

697
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
so inside of here if we have any error

698
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,400
so inside of here if we have any error
let's console.log

699
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,410
let's console.log

700
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,750
let's console.log
[Music]

701
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
[Music]

702
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,949
[Music]
the error and let's

703
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
the error and let's

704
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,389
the error and let's
only do this if there is any error so

705
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
only do this if there is any error so

706
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,710
only do this if there is any error so
um if error then do this

707
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
um if error then do this

708
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,790
um if error then do this
and let's see what happens right so we

709
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
and let's see what happens right so we

710
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,069
and let's see what happens right so we
have the endpoint

711
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
have the endpoint

712
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,310
have the endpoint
and we come here and we do this we just

713
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
and we come here and we do this we just

714
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,990
and we come here and we do this we just
need to set the delete review

715
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
need to set the delete review

716
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,230
need to set the delete review
whenever we click the button so let's

717
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
whenever we click the button so let's

718
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,430
whenever we click the button so let's
come to the delete button

719
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
come to the delete button

720

nothing happens let's see what error

733
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,069
nothing happens let's see what error
appeared so i get what's happening

734
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
appeared so i get what's happening

735
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,110
appeared so i get what's happening
basically we we can't just set an object

736
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
basically we we can't just set an object

737
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,910
basically we we can't just set an object
like this

738
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
like this

739
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,350
like this
we're going to try to send the object

740
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
we're going to try to send the object

741
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,949
we're going to try to send the object
through the parameters of

742
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
through the parameters of

743
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,509
through the parameters of
the url itself right so basically

744
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
the url itself right so basically

745
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,110
the url itself right so basically
instead of just calling it slash api

746
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
instead of just calling it slash api

747
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,990
instead of just calling it slash api
slash delete

748
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
slash delete

749
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,110
slash delete
we're going to call slash api slash a

750
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
we're going to call slash api slash a

751
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,629
we're going to call slash api slash a
variable and we're going to pass the

752
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
variable and we're going to pass the

753
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,629
variable and we're going to pass the
variable directly on the route and this

754
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
variable directly on the route and this

755
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,710
variable directly on the route and this
variable is going to be the movie name

756
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
variable is going to be the movie name

757
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,910
variable is going to be the movie name
so i'm going to remove this and

758
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
so i'm going to remove this and

759
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,230
so i'm going to remove this and
i'm going to even change this quotes to

760
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
i'm going to even change this quotes to

761
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,550
i'm going to even change this quotes to
become

762
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
become

763
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,710
become
this this type of quote because then we

764
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
this this type of quote because then we

765
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,629
this this type of quote because then we
can pass variables inside of this

766
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
can pass variables inside of this

767
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,470
can pass variables inside of this
and inside of here we're going to set

768
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
and inside of here we're going to set

769
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,670
and inside of here we're going to set
the movie name

770
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
the movie name

771
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,910
the movie name
but i just realized something as well i

772
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
but i just realized something as well i

773
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,509
but i just realized something as well i
was setting the movie name

774
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
was setting the movie name

775
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,150
was setting the movie name
as whatever to object we're trying to

776
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
as whatever to object we're trying to

777
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,710
as whatever to object we're trying to
delete

778
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
delete

779
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,150
delete
but this is incorrect because the movie

780
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
but this is incorrect because the movie

781
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,150
but this is incorrect because the movie
name represents the variable

782
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
name represents the variable

783
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,629
name represents the variable
that is currently being written on the

784
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
that is currently being written on the

785
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,829
that is currently being written on the
the input right so

786
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
the input right so

787
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,790
the input right so
basically we want to delete the specific

788
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
basically we want to delete the specific

789
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,310
basically we want to delete the specific
uh movie that we're trying to

790
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
uh movie that we're trying to

791
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,389
uh movie that we're trying to
that we're clicking the button so for

792
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
that we're clicking the button so for

793
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,230
that we're clicking the button so for
that we need to pass a variable

794
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
that we need to pass a variable

795
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,550
that we need to pass a variable
inside of the delete function so on the

796
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
inside of the delete function so on the

797
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,310
inside of the delete function so on the
on click event i'm going to

798
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
on click event i'm going to

799
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,389
on click event i'm going to
create this this syntax so that we can

800
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
create this this syntax so that we can

801
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,150
create this this syntax so that we can
pass a variable to our function

802
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
pass a variable to our function

803
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,310
pass a variable to our function
and over here on the delete review i'm

804
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
and over here on the delete review i'm

805
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,350

on instead of slash api slash delete
we're going to

834
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
we're going to

835
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,829
we're going to
make slash api slash delete and we're

836
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
make slash api slash delete and we're

837
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,749
make slash api slash delete and we're
going to add the following syntax which

838
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
going to add the following syntax which

839
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,069
going to add the following syntax which
is

840
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
is

841
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,230
is
how you create a way so that you can

842
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
how you create a way so that you can

843
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,910
how you create a way so that you can
pass parameters to your

844
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
pass parameters to your

845
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,150
pass parameters to your
your route we're going to add the colon

846
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
your route we're going to add the colon

847
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,389
your route we're going to add the colon
and then the name of your of whatever

848
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
and then the name of your of whatever

849
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,749
and then the name of your of whatever
variable we're passing so we're passing

850
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
variable we're passing so we're passing

851
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,550
variable we're passing so we're passing
a movie name

852
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560


853
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,189
and over here instead of wreck the body

854
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,030
and over here instead of wreck the body
we're grabbing

855
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,040
we're grabbing

856
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,269
we're grabbing
rack.params and now this should be

called app.put and

890
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,110
called app.put and
instead of this is going to be the

891
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
instead of this is going to be the

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,669
let's change this to an sql update
and for those who don't know the the

911
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
and for those who don't know the the

912
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,750
and for those who don't know the the
syntax or the command to update

syntax or the command to update

914
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,309
syntax or the command to update
stuff under mysql database or any other

915
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
stuff under mysql database or any other

916
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,309
stuff under mysql database or any other
sql type language

917
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
sql type language

918
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,789
sql type language
basically you just need to write update

919
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
basically you just need to write update

920
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,069
basically you just need to write update
set

921
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
set

922
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,350
set
wait update set

923
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360


924
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,430
basically let's think the name of the

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,909
and the name of the column so we're

928
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,789
and the name of the column so we're
trying to update

929
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
trying to update

question mark and the question mark is

936
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,830
question mark and the question mark is
something we're going to is the variable

937
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
something we're going to is the variable

938
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,430
something we're going to is the variable
that we're going to pass right here

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
so oh i also need to write a where right

942
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,630
so oh i also need to write a where right
so where

943
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640

and we're going to change this to sql

1001
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,669
and we're going to change this to sql
update and this should be

1002
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
update and this should be

1003
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,710
update and this should be
working so basically i forgot to mention

1004
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
working so basically i forgot to mention

1005
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,150
working so basically i forgot to mention
that

1006
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
that

1007
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,029
that
this is this is the the four different

1008
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
this is this is the the four different

1009
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,430
this is this is the the four different
ways you can treat an http request

1010
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
ways you can treat an http request

1011
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,110
ways you can treat an http request
you can get information which is the the

1012
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
you can get information which is the the

1013
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,669
you can get information which is the the
read part of the crud you can post

1014
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
read part of the crud you can post

1015
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,590
read part of the crud you can post
information which is the

1016
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
information which is the

1017
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,190
information which is the
the insert part or the create part

1018
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200
the insert part or the create part

1019
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,549
the insert part or the create part
then whenever you want to delete there's

1020
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
then whenever you want to delete there's

1021
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,990
then whenever you want to delete there's
the delete and whenever you want to

1022

the delete and whenever you want to
update there's the put

update there's the put

1025
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,669
update there's the put
so this is how you you always work with

1026
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
so this is how you you always work with

1027
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,470
so this is how you you always work with
the different

1028
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
the different

1029
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,070
the different
http requests so let's go to our front

1030
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
http requests so let's go to our front

1031
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,470

end

1033
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,070
end
and let's create a function called

1034
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
and let's create a function called

1035
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,430
and let's create a function called
um update review

1036
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
um update review

1037
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,110
