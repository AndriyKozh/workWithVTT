hey guys how's it going i'm back here hey guys how's it going i'm back here hey guys how's it going i'm back here with another video of my series where i with another video of my series where i with another video of my series where i teach you guys how to make a credit teach you guys how to make a credit teach you guys how to make a credit application from the beginning application from the beginning application from the beginning and i know the last video was pretty and i know the last video was pretty and i know the last video was pretty long it was like minutes long long it was like minutes long long it was like minutes long but i think this is the last video of my but i think this is the last video of my but i think this is the last video of my series so series so series so currently we can read like everything currently we can read like everything currently we can read like everything from the database from the database from the database and we can also insert everything in our and we can also insert everything in our and we can also insert everything in our database database database and what we need to do left is maybe and what we need to do left is maybe and what we need to do left is maybe i'm thinking like trying to to make a i'm thinking like trying to to make a i'm thinking like trying to to make a way so that whenever you add a movie way so that whenever you add a movie way so that whenever you add a movie to our database you don't need to to our database you don't need to to our database you don't need to refresh the page because currently for refresh the page because currently for refresh the page because currently for example example example if i write here fast if i write here fast if i write here fast and furious right and and furious right and and furious right and i come here and write very good and i i come here and write very good and i i come here and write very good and i submit submit submit nothing appears you need to refresh the nothing appears you need to refresh the nothing appears you need to refresh the page so that it will page so that it will page so that it will fetch the new information from the fetch the new information from the fetch the new information from the database why is this happening database why is this happening database why is this happening basically we are only wait let me come basically we are only wait let me come basically we are only wait let me come to app js to app js to app js we're only getting the information we're only getting the information we're only getting the information whenever the use effect hook is called whenever the use effect hook is called whenever the use effect hook is called and this only happens once whenever the and this only happens once whenever the and this only happens once whenever the page is rendered so we need to fix that page is rendered so we need to fix that page is rendered so we need to fix that so that whenever we just click here we so that whenever we just click here we so that whenever we just click here we don't need to refresh the page don't need to refresh the page don't need to refresh the page and this is basically one of the best and this is basically one of the best and this is basically one of the best things that react can do and we're going things that react can do and we're going things that react can do and we're going to take advantage of that to take advantage of that to take advantage of that and also i'm thinking we need to style and also i'm thinking we need to style and also i'm thinking we need to style this a bit so that we can have like a this a bit so that we can have like a this a bit so that we can have like a nice nice nice card for each movie and in each card card for each movie and in each card card for each movie and in each card there's going to be there's going to be there's going to be maybe an update button and maybe an update button and maybe an update button and a delete button so we can finish the a delete button so we can finish the a delete button so we can finish the crud crud crud aspect of our application which like up aspect of our application which like up aspect of our application which like up it means it means it means basically update and delete and i think basically update and delete and i think basically update and delete and i think that's it that's it that's it so the first thing we're going to do is so the first thing we're going to do is so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to make the we're going to make the we're going to make the application be able to update itself application be able to update itself application be able to update itself cons cons cons consistently so let's come here consistently so let's come here consistently so let's come here and you know that we have a movie review and you know that we have a movie review and you know that we have a movie review list list list this is basically the the list that is this is basically the the list that is this is basically the the list that is displaying right here with all the names displaying right here with all the names displaying right here with all the names so whenever we click on submit review i so whenever we click on submit review i so whenever we click on submit review i simply want to add simply want to add simply want to add the the new movie that i'm that i'm the the new movie that i'm that i'm the the new movie that i'm that i'm submitting into that list submitting into that list submitting into that list so i'll just grab set movie list so i'll just grab set movie list so i'll just grab set movie list and i'll come here and i'll erase this and i'll come here and i'll erase this and i'll come here and i'll erase this and i'll set the movie list equal to and i'll set the movie list equal to and i'll set the movie list equal to the current movie list so movie list the current movie list so movie list the current movie list so movie list and i'm also going to add some dots and i'm also going to add some dots and i'm also going to add some dots before it so and and and want to add the new movie that we're want to add the new movie that we're want to add the new movie that we're adding to our database adding to our database adding to our database which is basically an object with the which is basically an object with the which is basically an object with the movie name and the movie name and the movie name and the movie review so um movie review so um movie review so um Music Music Music movie name equals to the current movie movie name equals to the current movie movie name equals to the current movie name name name and review i think it's review and review i think it's review and review i think it's review let me look at the object um let me look at the object um let me look at the object um let me see when we're displaying let me see when we're displaying let me see when we're displaying basically basically basically it's a movie name and movie review okay it's a movie name and movie review okay it's a movie name and movie review okay so movie review is equal to review so now is equal to review so now is equal to review so now whenever we're adding something to the whenever we're adding something to the whenever we're adding something to the database we're also database we're also database we're also after after making the post request after after making the post request after after making the post request request we're also request we're also request we're also setting the movie list with equal to the setting the movie list with equal to the setting the movie list with equal to the same movie list same movie list same movie list but pushing a new element which is the but pushing a new element which is the but pushing a new element which is the one we're submitting to our database one we're submitting to our database one we're submitting to our database and let's try this again so if i add a and let's try this again so if i add a and let's try this again so if i add a movie movie movie for example uh let me think of a movie for example uh let me think of a movie for example uh let me think of a movie um i don't know hobbit um i don't know hobbit um i don't know hobbit and i give it a review nice and i give it a review nice and i give it a review nice movie and i press submit you can see movie and i press submit you can see movie and i press submit you can see that that that nothing happens why is it happening let nothing happens why is it happening let nothing happens why is it happening let me let me look at the inspect element me let me look at the inspect element me let me look at the inspect element um each child this isn't the problem um each child this isn't the problem um each child this isn't the problem let me refresh it and if we refresh it let me refresh it and if we refresh it let me refresh it and if we refresh it it works but it works but it works but why is it not working okay guys i fixed why is it not working okay guys i fixed why is it not working okay guys i fixed it basically it basically it basically i was setting everything on the promise i was setting everything on the promise i was setting everything on the promise basically after the post request there basically after the post request there basically after the post request there was was was a dot then and that wasn't working so a dot then and that wasn't working so a dot then and that wasn't working so what i would recommend what i would recommend what i would recommend is just separating both so make the is just separating both so make the is just separating both so make the excuse post request over here excuse post request over here excuse post request over here and then set the movie list so if i come and then set the movie list so if i come and then set the movie list so if i come here and write here and write here and write the name of a random movie like percy the name of a random movie like percy the name of a random movie like percy jackson jackson jackson and you can see like there's no percy and you can see like there's no percy and you can see like there's no percy jackson here jackson here jackson here um nice movie um nice movie um nice movie and i press submit now percy jackson and i press submit now percy jackson and i press submit now percy jackson appears here and i don't need to refresh appears here and i don't need to refresh appears here and i don't need to refresh my page my page my page so basically that's it so what i'm so basically that's it so what i'm so basically that's it so what i'm thinking we need to do now is style this thinking we need to do now is style this thinking we need to do now is style this a bit because you're you're seeing that a bit because you're you're seeing that a bit because you're you're seeing that this this this it's like taking a lot of space it's not it's like taking a lot of space it's not it's like taking a lot of space it's not it's not visually it's not visually it's not visually uh pleasing and also like we need to uh pleasing and also like we need to uh pleasing and also like we need to make it into some cards right make it into some cards right make it into some cards right so let's create a card right here so so let's create a card right here so so let's create a card right here so um over here we're going instead of just um over here we're going instead of just um over here we're going instead of just making it making it uh h1 i'm going to making it making it uh h1 i'm going to making it making it uh h1 i'm going to make it a div make it a div make it a div and the div will have a class name and the div will have a class name and the div will have a class name of um card of um card of um card and then inside of here there's going to and then inside of here there's going to and then inside of here there's going to be a be a be a an h1 which is basically going to be the an h1 which is basically going to be the an h1 which is basically going to be the movie movie movie and there's no not like i'm going to and there's no not like i'm going to and there's no not like i'm going to erase this movie name part because erase this movie name part because erase this movie name part because we're gonna try to make it a little bit we're gonna try to make it a little bit we're gonna try to make it a little bit prettier so prettier so prettier so we're just putting the movie name on the we're just putting the movie name on the we're just putting the movie name on the top and on the bottom we're we're adding top and on the bottom we're we're adding top and on the bottom we're we're adding the review the review the review as like a description so let me just as like a description so let me just as like a description so let me just create a paragraph tag and i'm gonna even erase the movie review i'm gonna even erase the movie review i'm gonna even erase the movie review uh label so let's look at this you can uh label so let's look at this you can uh label so let's look at this you can see this is basically how it's gonna see this is basically how it's gonna see this is basically how it's gonna look look look it's gonna have the title and on the it's gonna have the title and on the it's gonna have the title and on the bottom the the little review right bottom the the little review right bottom the the little review right but we're gonna make this look better so but we're gonna make this look better so but we're gonna make this look better so app css app css app css i'm gonna grab here and call the card i'm gonna grab here and call the card i'm gonna grab here and call the card and make it um let me think a width and make it um let me think a width and make it um let me think a width of like pixels of like pixels of like pixels then a height of like pixels then a height of like pixels then a height of like pixels then some borders so border two pixels then some borders so border two pixels then some borders so border two pixels solid solid solid and black and black and black let's make it simple and let's add a let's make it simple and let's add a let's make it simple and let's add a border radius because i always think border radius because i always think border radius because i always think they look they look they look nice so border radius of like pixels nice so border radius of like pixels nice so border radius of like pixels let's take a look at how it's looking let's take a look at how it's looking let's take a look at how it's looking it's a bit too big it's a bit too big it's a bit too big so i'm gonna make this a hundred so i'm gonna make this a hundred so i'm gonna make this a hundred and no actually was looking and no actually was looking and no actually was looking now and i'm adding a margin to this now and i'm adding a margin to this now and i'm adding a margin to this so margin so margin so margin of like pixels okay of like pixels okay of like pixels okay it's looking cool um i'm thinking of it's looking cool um i'm thinking of it's looking cool um i'm thinking of maybe maybe maybe changing the the font just changing the the font just changing the the font just just so we can like add some style to it just so we can like add some style to it just so we can like add some style to it so so so font family font family font family and i'm gonna grab something over here and i'm gonna grab something over here and i'm gonna grab something over here i'm gonna use trebuchet i think this is i'm gonna use trebuchet i think this is i'm gonna use trebuchet i think this is the name the name the name i feel like this like i know this font i feel like this like i know this font i feel like this like i know this font is really cool so is really cool so is really cool so you can see that everything now looks you can see that everything now looks you can see that everything now looks pretty good and pretty good and pretty good and let me think what else we can do maybe let me think what else we can do maybe let me think what else we can do maybe now we need to add the two buttons right now we need to add the two buttons right now we need to add the two buttons right the button for delete and the button for the button for delete and the button for the button for delete and the button for update so let's come to the bottom here update so let's come to the bottom here update so let's come to the bottom here and edit button delete and delete and delete and let's add another but let's actually add let's add another but let's actually add let's add another but let's actually add a um a um a um how do i say this let's just add an how do i say this let's just add an how do i say this let's just add an input right input right input right so input with type text text text and this is going to be the update input and this is going to be the update input and this is going to be the update input so whatever right here is so whatever right here is so whatever right here is basically going to be whatever we want basically going to be whatever we want basically going to be whatever we want to change to change to change and we're only going to be able to and we're only going to be able to and we're only going to be able to change the movie review i'm not going to change the movie review i'm not going to change the movie review i'm not going to make it so that make it so that make it so that you can update the title because that you can update the title because that you can update the title because that doesn't make like that doesn't make doesn't make like that doesn't make doesn't make like that doesn't make sense sense sense so and this button is going to be update so and this button is going to be update so and this button is going to be update okay let's look how it looks it looks okay let's look how it looks it looks okay let's look how it looks it looks pretty horrible pretty horrible pretty horrible you know why because we need to grab the you know why because we need to grab the you know why because we need to grab the it's not like it's not like it's not like it's basically making the input huge it's basically making the input huge it's basically making the input huge because i set the inputs here because i set the inputs here because i set the inputs here to be huge so that this looks good so to be huge so that this looks good so to be huge so that this looks good so what i'm going to do is i'm going to add what i'm going to do is i'm going to add what i'm going to do is i'm going to add an id for this an id for this an id for this so um id and this id is basically going to be id and this id is basically going to be id and this id is basically going to be the the the update input and we're going to style it update input and we're going to style it update input and we're going to style it on our own so if we come here on our own so if we come here on our own so if we come here and write update and write update and write update input and let me say input and let me say input and let me say width is equal to like pixels maybe width is equal to like pixels maybe width is equal to like pixels maybe something like that something like that something like that and height is equal to something small and height is equal to something small and height is equal to something small like pixels like pixels like pixels um let's look how it looks um it's still um let's look how it looks um it's still um let's look how it looks um it's still pretty pretty pretty not that good i need to increase maybe not that good i need to increase maybe not that good i need to increase maybe the size of the the size of the the size of the the card yeah i'm gonna make this the card yeah i'm gonna make this the card yeah i'm gonna make this again again again let's see how it looks now let's see how it looks now let's see how it looks now Music Music Music it still doesn't look good maybe decrease the size of of these things decrease the size of of these things decrease the size of of these things make this um and add a margin to this make this um and add a margin to this make this um and add a margin to this a margin bottom so a margin bottom so a margin bottom so margin bottom of like pixels margin bottom of like pixels margin bottom of like pixels let's see how it looks it's still the let's see how it looks it's still the let's see how it looks it's still the same so i'm gonna just increase this to same so i'm gonna just increase this to same so i'm gonna just increase this to and and and i think this this should be good yeah so i think this this should be good yeah so i think this this should be good yeah so we have our delete button we have our we have our delete button we have our we have our delete button we have our update but update but update but our update input and our update button our update input and our update button our update input and our update button right so right so right so let's make it so that whenever you click let's make it so that whenever you click let's make it so that whenever you click delete you can delete everything here delete you can delete everything here delete you can delete everything here so let's come here and create a function so let's come here and create a function so let's come here and create a function called delete review called delete review called delete review const delete review const delete review const delete review equal to like the arrow syntax equal to like the arrow syntax equal to like the arrow syntax and let's make an x use dot delete request and instead of here we're delete request and instead of here we're delete request and instead of here we're going to set our url going to set our url going to set our url i'm going to just copy this and i'm going to just copy this and i'm going to just copy this and set it right here we're going to set it set it right here we're going to set it set it right here we're going to set it equal to a slash api equal to a slash api equal to a slash api slash delete because we're going to slash delete because we're going to slash delete because we're going to create that and create that and create that and let's send a variable maybe just the let's send a variable maybe just the let's send a variable maybe just the the movie name movie name and now actually i'm thinking the idea and now actually i'm thinking the idea and now actually i'm thinking the idea right right right no but we're not setting the id okay so no but we're not setting the id okay so no but we're not setting the id okay so let's just send the movie name let's just send the movie name let's just send the movie name and that should be good and that should be good and that should be good so let's go to our back end and let's so let's go to our back end and let's so let's go to our back end and let's create a create a create a app delete api endpoint right so app delete api endpoint right so app delete api endpoint right so app delete app delete app delete and this is going to be as we mentioned and this is going to be as we mentioned and this is going to be as we mentioned before slash before slash before slash api slash delete and there's going to be api slash delete and there's going to be api slash delete and there's going to be a a a require a response require a response require a response and we're going to create a function out and we're going to create a function out and we're going to create a function out of it so we're going to grab of it so we're going to grab of it so we're going to grab first the the movie name so const name first the the movie name so const name first the the movie name so const name equal to rec the body dot movie name equal to rec the body dot movie name equal to rec the body dot movie name and let's create the and let's create the and let's create the sql syntax for this right sql syntax for this right sql syntax for this right so let's come here and so let's come here and so let's come here and insert into movie we're gonna change insert into movie we're gonna change insert into movie we're gonna change this this this basically this is going to be delete basically this is going to be delete basically this is going to be delete from the name of the database from the name of the database from the name of the database the name of the table so movie reviews the name of the table so movie reviews the name of the table so movie reviews and where and where and where and this is the case right so where and this is the case right so where and this is the case right so where movie name equal to whatever we're movie name equal to whatever we're movie name equal to whatever we're setting right so setting right so setting right so let's grab movie name and i'm going to let's grab movie name and i'm going to let's grab movie name and i'm going to explain this better explain this better explain this better movie name equal to question mark so movie name equal to question mark so movie name equal to question mark so basically what we're saying here is basically what we're saying here is basically what we're saying here is delete from the table where the movie delete from the table where the movie delete from the table where the movie name name name is equal to the movie name that we set is equal to the movie name that we set is equal to the movie name that we set over here so over here so over here so we're deleting whatever movie has this we're deleting whatever movie has this we're deleting whatever movie has this name and name and name and if we come here the reason why we're if we come here the reason why we're if we come here the reason why we're putting a question putting a question putting a question mark as i said in the last video is so mark as i said in the last video is so mark as i said in the last video is so that we can sanitize our input so that we can sanitize our input so that we can sanitize our input so basically basically basically we can just set the variable here we can just set the variable here we can just set the variable here instead of directly instead of directly instead of directly inside of the the string and this is inside of the the string and this is inside of the the string and this is important for important for important for for various different reasons so if i for various different reasons so if i for various different reasons so if i come here and put come here and put come here and put database query and i add database query and i add database query and i add the sql oh i'm going to change this name the sql oh i'm going to change this name the sql oh i'm going to change this name so ask so ask so ask ql delete and i add this variable here ql delete and i add this variable here ql delete and i add this variable here and then on the side i add the name and and then on the side i add the name and and then on the side i add the name and as you can see like as you can see like as you can see like since this is only taking one variable i since this is only taking one variable i since this is only taking one variable i don't need to create a don't need to create a don't need to create a an array like i created last time an array like i created last time an array like i created last time because this time i was setting two because this time i was setting two because this time i was setting two variables two question marks and this variables two question marks and this variables two question marks and this one i'm only setting once one i'm only setting once one i'm only setting once and that also comes into place when i'm and that also comes into place when i'm and that also comes into place when i'm when i'm sending when i'm sending when i'm sending the data through the access request as the data through the access request as the data through the access request as you can see on the you can see on the you can see on the actual stop post where we inserted data actual stop post where we inserted data actual stop post where we inserted data into the database into the database into the database we're sending two pieces of information we're sending two pieces of information we're sending two pieces of information the movie name and the movie review the movie name and the movie review the movie name and the movie review that's why we created an object but in that's why we created an object but in that's why we created an object but in this case we're only setting this case we're only setting this case we're only setting uh one object one one variable which is uh one object one one variable which is uh one object one one variable which is the movie name so we don't really need the movie name so we don't really need the movie name so we don't really need to create an object out of it to create an object out of it to create an object out of it so now we have this function right here so now we have this function right here so now we have this function right here right so we have the delete review right so we have the delete review right so we have the delete review and we created the app delete and we created the app delete and we created the app delete route on the back end we just need to route on the back end we just need to route on the back end we just need to then set a a function out of this so then set a a function out of this so then set a a function out of this so error results and let's grab this information and i'm also let's grab this information and i'm also let's grab this information and i'm also going to do this going to do this going to do this so inside of here if we have any error so inside of here if we have any error so inside of here if we have any error let's console log let's console log let's console log Music Music Music the error and let's the error and let's the error and let's only do this if there is any error so only do this if there is any error so only do this if there is any error so um if error then do this um if error then do this um if error then do this and let's see what happens right so we and let's see what happens right so we and let's see what happens right so we have the endpoint have the endpoint have the endpoint and we come here and we do this we just and we come here and we do this we just and we come here and we do this we just need to set the delete review need to set the delete review need to set the delete review whenever we click the button so let's whenever we click the button so let's whenever we click the button so let's come to the delete button come to the delete button come to the delete button and press on click equal to and press on click equal to and press on click equal to delete review right so for example if delete review right so for example if delete review right so for example if i'm trying to delete i'm trying to delete i'm trying to delete the this review right here the this review right here the this review right here i can just come here and press delete i can just come here and press delete i can just come here and press delete and when i refresh the page nothing happens let's see what error nothing happens let's see what error nothing happens let's see what error appeared so i get what's happening appeared so i get what's happening appeared so i get what's happening basically we we can't just set an object basically we we can't just set an object basically we we can't just set an object like this like this like this we're going to try to send the object we're going to try to send the object we're going to try to send the object through the parameters of through the parameters of through the parameters of the url itself right so basically the url itself right so basically the url itself right so basically instead of just calling it slash api instead of just calling it slash api instead of just calling it slash api slash delete slash delete slash delete we're going to call slash api slash a we're going to call slash api slash a we're going to call slash api slash a variable and we're going to pass the variable and we're going to pass the variable and we're going to pass the variable directly on the route and this variable directly on the route and this variable directly on the route and this variable is going to be the movie name variable is going to be the movie name variable is going to be the movie name so i'm going to remove this and so i'm going to remove this and so i'm going to remove this and i'm going to even change this quotes to i'm going to even change this quotes to i'm going to even change this quotes to become become become this this type of quote because then we this this type of quote because then we this this type of quote because then we can pass variables inside of this can pass variables inside of this can pass variables inside of this and inside of here we're going to set and inside of here we're going to set and inside of here we're going to set the movie name the movie name the movie name but i just realized something as well i but i just realized something as well i but i just realized something as well i was setting the movie name was setting the movie name was setting the movie name as whatever to object we're trying to as whatever to object we're trying to as whatever to object we're trying to delete delete delete but this is incorrect because the movie but this is incorrect because the movie but this is incorrect because the movie name represents the variable name represents the variable name represents the variable that is currently being written on the that is currently being written on the that is currently being written on the the input right so the input right so the input right so basically we want to delete the specific basically we want to delete the specific basically we want to delete the specific uh movie that we're trying to uh movie that we're trying to uh movie that we're trying to that we're clicking the button so for that we're clicking the button so for that we're clicking the button so for that we need to pass a variable that we need to pass a variable that we need to pass a variable inside of the delete function so on the inside of the delete function so on the inside of the delete function so on the on click event i'm going to on click event i'm going to on click event i'm going to create this this syntax so that we can create this this syntax so that we can create this this syntax so that we can pass a variable to our function pass a variable to our function pass a variable to our function and over here on the delete review i'm and over here on the delete review i'm and over here on the delete review i'm going to pass the going to pass the going to pass the value the movie name so that for every value the movie name so that for every value the movie name so that for every delete review delete review delete review we have a different movie that we're we have a different movie that we're we have a different movie that we're passing so passing so passing so if i come here and i create um if i come here and i create um if i come here and i create um a name over here like for example movie a name over here like for example movie a name over here like for example movie and instead of movie name i said here and instead of movie name i said here and instead of movie name i said here movie then now we're sending the correct movie then now we're sending the correct movie then now we're sending the correct information information information to our backend and if we come back to to our backend and if we come back to to our backend and if we come back to our to our back and i'm going to change our to our back and i'm going to change our to our back and i'm going to change some stuff some stuff some stuff on instead of slash api slash delete on instead of slash api slash delete on instead of slash api slash delete we're going to we're going to we're going to make slash api slash delete and we're make slash api slash delete and we're make slash api slash delete and we're going to add the following syntax which going to add the following syntax which going to add the following syntax which is is is how you create a way so that you can how you create a way so that you can how you create a way so that you can pass parameters to your pass parameters to your pass parameters to your your route we're going to add the colon your route we're going to add the colon your route we're going to add the colon and then the name of your of whatever and then the name of your of whatever and then the name of your of whatever variable we're passing so we're passing variable we're passing so we're passing variable we're passing so we're passing a movie name and over here instead of wreck the body and over here instead of wreck the body and over here instead of wreck the body we're grabbing we're grabbing we're grabbing rack params and now this should be rack params and now this should be rack params and now this should be completely correct completely correct completely correct if i come back here and i refresh my if i come back here and i refresh my if i come back here and i refresh my browser and i try to delete browser and i try to delete browser and i try to delete this right here and i click delete you this right here and i click delete you this right here and i click delete you can see that now it's completely deleted can see that now it's completely deleted can see that now it's completely deleted from our database it's deleted from our from our database it's deleted from our from our database it's deleted from our from our front end it's all correct from our front end it's all correct from our front end it's all correct right so now we have right so now we have right so now we have the following project so it's working we the following project so it's working we the following project so it's working we have a delete functionality have a delete functionality have a delete functionality we just need to do one more thing which we just need to do one more thing which we just need to do one more thing which is create the update functionality is create the update functionality is create the update functionality so we're coming back to our backend and so we're coming back to our backend and so we're coming back to our backend and let's create another route called let's create another route called let's create another route called um another api endpoint sorry um another api endpoint sorry um another api endpoint sorry called app put and called app put and called app put and instead of this is going to be the instead of this is going to be the instead of this is going to be the update slash update update slash update update slash update and we're grabbing we're doing it based and we're grabbing we're doing it based and we're grabbing we're doing it based on the movie review on the movie review on the movie review right so we're grabbing should we right so we're grabbing should we right so we're grabbing should we actually do it based on no we're doing actually do it based on no we're doing actually do it based on no we're doing based on based on based on movie name but we're trying to update movie name but we're trying to update movie name but we're trying to update the movie review so the movie review so the movie review so let's change this to an sql update let's change this to an sql update let's change this to an sql update and for those who don't know the the and for those who don't know the the and for those who don't know the the syntax or the command to update syntax or the command to update syntax or the command to update stuff under mysql database or any other stuff under mysql database or any other stuff under mysql database or any other sql type language sql type language sql type language basically you just need to write update basically you just need to write update basically you just need to write update set set set wait update set basically let's think the name of the basically let's think the name of the basically let's think the name of the the table right so movie reviews and the name of the column so we're and the name of the column so we're and the name of the column so we're trying to update trying to update trying to update movie review movie review movie review is the name of the column equal to is the name of the column equal to is the name of the column equal to question mark and the question mark is question mark and the question mark is question mark and the question mark is something we're going to is the variable something we're going to is the variable something we're going to is the variable that we're going to pass right here that we're going to pass right here that we're going to pass right here so oh i also need to write a where right so oh i also need to write a where right so oh i also need to write a where right so where so where so where um movie name equals to this so um movie name equals to this so um movie name equals to this so basically basically basically we're saying update the the table movie we're saying update the the table movie we're saying update the the table movie reviews and set the reviews and set the reviews and set the the column movie review equal to some the column movie review equal to some the column movie review equal to some variable variable variable where the movie name is equal to where the movie name is equal to where the movie name is equal to something so we're specifying something so we're specifying something so we're specifying which column we want to change based on which column we want to change based on which column we want to change based on the movie name the movie name the movie name and for that reason we need to grab two and for that reason we need to grab two and for that reason we need to grab two things we need to grab the movie name things we need to grab the movie name things we need to grab the movie name and the movie and the movie and the movie and the movie review right so movie and the movie review right so movie and the movie review right so movie review review review and we're not gonna use params we're and we're not gonna use params we're and we're not gonna use params we're gonna use buddy gonna use buddy gonna use buddy so wreck the body and correct the body so wreck the body and correct the body so wreck the body and correct the body the movie review it's going to be really the movie review it's going to be really the movie review it's going to be really similar to the insert statement similar to the insert statement similar to the insert statement and over here we're not we're not and over here we're not we're not and over here we're not we're not passing only one variable so we need to passing only one variable so we need to passing only one variable so we need to pass an array pass an array pass an array and we need to put it in order right so and we need to put it in order right so and we need to put it in order right so the first variable that we're asking is the first variable that we're asking is the first variable that we're asking is the movie review the movie review the movie review so we're going to pass the review and the second one is the name okay and the second one is the name okay and the second one is the name okay and we're going to change this to sql and we're going to change this to sql and we're going to change this to sql update and this should be update and this should be update and this should be working so basically i forgot to mention working so basically i forgot to mention working so basically i forgot to mention that that that this is this is the the four different this is this is the the four different this is this is the the four different ways you can treat an http request ways you can treat an http request ways you can treat an http request you can get information which is the the you can get information which is the the you can get information which is the the read part of the crud you can post read part of the crud you can post read part of the crud you can post information which is the information which is the information which is the the insert part or the create part the insert part or the create part the insert part or the create part then whenever you want to delete there's then whenever you want to delete there's then whenever you want to delete there's the delete and whenever you want to the delete and whenever you want to the delete and whenever you want to update there's the put update there's the put update there's the put so this is how you you always work with so this is how you you always work with so this is how you you always work with the different the different the different http requests so let's go to our front http requests so let's go to our front http requests so let's go to our front end end end and let's create a function called and let's create a function called and let's create a function called um update review um update review um update review update review update review update review and let's grab here and and let's grab here and and let's grab here and let's try to make let's try to pass a let's try to make let's try to pass a let's try to make let's try to pass a variable we're passing the movie name variable we're passing the movie name variable we're passing the movie name so yeah let's let's still use movie and so yeah let's let's still use movie and so yeah let's let's still use movie and instead of this instead of this instead of this let's change it to xs put and let's let's change it to xs put and let's let's change it to xs put and let's remove this let's make it a simple remove this let's make it a simple remove this let's make it a simple url without any params and url without any params and url without any params and this is going to be api update right this is going to be api update right this is going to be api update right and let's pass another variable just and let's pass another variable just and let's pass another variable just like we did on the app post like we did on the app post like we did on the app post because we can do this for the update because we can do this for the update because we can do this for the update and and and let's create a state right we need to let's create a state right we need to let's create a state right we need to create a state for the variable that create a state for the variable that create a state for the variable that we're currently we're currently we're currently like the input that we're currently like the input that we're currently like the input that we're currently currently trying to change so currently trying to change so currently trying to change so like let's come here and write const um new um new um new review and set review and set review and set new review and let's new review and let's new review and let's create a use state and set it equal to create a use state and set it equal to create a use state and set it equal to an empty an empty an empty string right so um whenever we string right so um whenever we string right so um whenever we work whenever on the whenever we change work whenever on the whenever we change work whenever on the whenever we change the input the input the input we want to set the we want to set the we want to set the Applause Applause Applause let me right here so when i set the let me right here so when i set the let me right here so when i set the set the new review equal to set the new review equal to set the new review equal to the event which we didn't create yet so the event which we didn't create yet so the event which we didn't create yet so e dot target e dot target e dot target dot value right this is really simple dot value right this is really simple dot value right this is really simple this is what we did on the other this is what we did on the other this is what we did on the other inputs in our application and now we're inputs in our application and now we're inputs in our application and now we're setting the new review equal to this setting the new review equal to this setting the new review equal to this we also want to um whenever we finish we also want to um whenever we finish we also want to um whenever we finish this we want to clear this we want to clear this we want to clear so set our new review variable equal to so set our new review variable equal to so set our new review variable equal to an empty string so that we can use it an empty string so that we can use it an empty string so that we can use it again if we're trying to update again if we're trying to update again if we're trying to update different movie reviews right so different movie reviews right so different movie reviews right so set new review set new review set new review equal to an empty stream because equal to an empty stream because equal to an empty stream because whenever we finish sending this whenever we finish sending this whenever we finish sending this information information information we're using the same variable for every we're using the same variable for every we're using the same variable for every single movie review single movie review single movie review so we want to set it equal to we want to so we want to set it equal to we want to so we want to set it equal to we want to clear it you know clear it you know clear it you know so this should be right and the movie so this should be right and the movie so this should be right and the movie we're passing the movie and the review we're passing the movie and the review we're passing the movie and the review we're passing the new we're passing the new we're passing the new review so let's also review so let's also review so let's also create an unclick event for this just create an unclick event for this just create an unclick event for this just like we did for the delete button like we did for the delete button like we did for the delete button because we're going to pass a variable because we're going to pass a variable because we're going to pass a variable here and here and here and let me write update review and we're let me write update review and we're let me write update review and we're going to pass the going to pass the going to pass the move the value the movie name move the value the movie name move the value the movie name right just like the the delete button so right just like the the delete button so right just like the the delete button so i have a feeling that this should be i have a feeling that this should be i have a feeling that this should be working but as i mentioned working but as i mentioned working but as i mentioned something there there's always something something there there's always something something there there's always something wrong so wrong so wrong so let's try this i'm going to refresh let's try this i'm going to refresh let's try this i'm going to refresh everything and i want to change the everything and i want to change the everything and i want to change the inception inception inception review from good movie to awesome movie review from good movie to awesome movie review from good movie to awesome movie and let me click update let's refresh and let me click update let's refresh and let me click update let's refresh the screen the screen the screen and it didn't work let's look at what and it didn't work let's look at what and it didn't work let's look at what happened so happened so happened so and we're back it didn't take long uh and we're back it didn't take long uh and we're back it didn't take long uh i i kind of already knew when i looked i i kind of already knew when i looked i i kind of already knew when i looked at my code again at my code again at my code again i already figured it out and as you can i already figured it out and as you can i already figured it out and as you can see we changed everything see we changed everything see we changed everything basically i wrote the sql statement basically i wrote the sql statement basically i wrote the sql statement wrong it's not update set wrong it's not update set wrong it's not update set the name of the table and the columns the name of the table and the columns the name of the table and the columns it's update the name of the table it's update the name of the table it's update the name of the table set the columns where movie name is set the columns where movie name is set the columns where movie name is equal to this equal to this equal to this it's really simple i don't know why i it's really simple i don't know why i it's really simple i don't know why i did that but that's okay did that but that's okay did that but that's okay so you can see that if i come here and so you can see that if i come here and so you can see that if i come here and first of all i'm going to delete first of all i'm going to delete first of all i'm going to delete all the smurfs so okay and if i want to all the smurfs so okay and if i want to all the smurfs so okay and if i want to change change change a harry potter to the best a harry potter to the best a harry potter to the best movie
